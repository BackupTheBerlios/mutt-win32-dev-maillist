It is possible if you compile mutt-win32 with pdcurses and make some
modification to the code.

It is known problem, but currently I have no sollution. Workaround:
set ascii_chars

Why you need such feature?

I have accidentally sent the message only to the developer and not to
the list. Forwarding.

Hi WBR,
I personally prefer to run the console programs in terminal, under
windows http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/. It has the
advantage, that it actually remembers typeface, font size, encoding
and window size, which the mutt window currently doesn't.
I am more concerned about the encoding feature. The "set ascii_chars"
workaround "fixed" it, but I am sure there must be a better option. I
am pretty sure, that the fonts I have tried have all the utf
characters normally used to create ascii art/boxes. I have had very
similar problem with putty when I had wrong encoding selected.
Could you please note in the README file, that the usual *nix
variables like $EDITOR have to be set in order for mutt to work
properly? I tried it with console vim, that didn't work, the process
was spawned, but went into deadlock right after that. Gvim is fine.
Getting message sending working might be a cool feature too :). There
is a msmtp binary for windows available. I also compiled a pgpewrap
with mingw and can make this binary available, so that we can use pgp
(one day).
Petr

It is possible when mutt-win32 is compiled with not modified pdcurses.

I am planing to add 'save settings' feature ASAP.

It will be fixed but i don't know when.

Ok.

I will think what we have to do with this.

You can send mail using smtp_url:
"smtp_url = smtp://username at hostname:port"

> There is a msmtp binary for windows available.

It will not work right now %(

Were there any problems when you tried to compile and use pgpewrap
with mutt-win32?

FYI: you can use GnuPG right now. Currently I'm using mutt-win32 with
imap and smtp and tried with pop3. Please look at .mutt/muttrc file
from distribution for details.

Hello Petr,

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/mutt-win32/test/2009.04.08/mutt_console.zip -
compiled as console application with pdcurses and can be used with
http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/. only 16 colors.

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/mutt-win32/test/2009.04.08/mutt_gui.zip - gui
version. It now remember font, font size and charset.

Common changes: synced with dev.mutt.org up to

Console programs (vim,..) invoked from mutt should work without problems.

Please try.
