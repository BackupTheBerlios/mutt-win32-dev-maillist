Subject: [Mutt-win32-dev] Feature request
Message-ID: <5eedb8e50903300852i4b186889o4605460e56e4d7ea@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have found today this fresh port of mutt for win32 and I am really
happy about it. One more of my favorite unix tools for windows. But I
have one feature request and one encoding problem. Is it possible to
make mutt run in the windows console instead of its own window? The
second problem I have is with fonts. I would like to use DejaVu Sans
Mono. Unfortunately, the line drawing characters in the tree message
view are broken. I tried several other fonts and all of them have the
same problem, except one - "Terminal". I have attached 2 screenshots
to this message to illustrate the problem.
Petr
